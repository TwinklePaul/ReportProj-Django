OneToOneField - Since, each user can work on only one profile.

class models.User
The Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system is great. For the most part we can use it out-of-the-box, saving a lot of development and testing effort. It fits most of the use cases and is very safe.

User objects have the following fields:
    username, first_name, last_name, email, password, groups, user_permissions, etc.

The class also has several methods and manager methods for ease-of-use.

on_delete = models.CASCADE ensures that on deleting a user, the profile gets deleted.
